# Stress Analysis

dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/laavanya/stress-level-detection?select=Stress-Lysis.csv

## Summary 

Based on the humanâ€™s physical activity, the stress levels of the human being are detected and analyzed here. A dataset of 2001 samples is provided for human body humidity, body temperature and the number of steps taken by the user. Three different classifications of stress are performed, low stress, normal stress, and high stress.



That's pretty much it for the dataset, for the front end we'll be using a weather map API and take steps as input.
